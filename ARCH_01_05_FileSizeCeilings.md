### 1.5 File-size ceilings
- **Soft 100 lines / hard 150 lines** per file. One **primary type per file**.
- **Functions ≤ 40 lines.**
- Rationale: any edit reads and rewrites the whole file, so file size is the per-edit
  token cost and the mis-match risk — smaller is strictly better. Nothing forces a
  large file: functions are capped, and a large class splits its method definitions
  across multiple `.cpp` files (`Type_Aspect_PROC.cpp`) behind one small header.
- Exceeding a ceiling requires a **documented work-order exception** (Constitution §7)
  — a deliberate ratchet, never silent drift.
